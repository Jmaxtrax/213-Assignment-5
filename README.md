213 Assignment 5, Joshua Heeren and Anthony Defoe

MusicShop.com is an online service that provides vocal or instrumental music to customers who like to sing or play instruments. On the “Browse Music” web page, customers select a genre of music from a drop-down list. The web page returns a list of performers, musicians, or groups that match the genre, which is formatted as a drop-down list. When a selection is made from this drop-down list, the web page displays all the related songs in a GridView. 
The viewer/customer can make multiple selections. When “Add to Shopping Cart” button is clicked, the songs are added to the shopping cart. Finally, the customer will proceed with the order and secure payment.

1)	Create a use-case diagram for online-users. One of use-cases should be “Browse Music Store”.
